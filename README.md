# S-VQVAE_Adversarial_Robustness
Effect and Analyses of S-VQVAEs for Adversarial Robustness

This Repo is the base code for my thesis "Discrete Representation for Adversarial Robustness", which examines the effect of the discrete latent space, as well as related concepts such as class divergence loss and adversarial training with DelayedAT on adversarial robustness.
